Questions

* Why do we have the package com.google.android.gcm, i.e. not com.iterate?

Tasks

* Remove app permissions that we don't need
* Before publication, set perhaps debuggable to false
* Remove files (html, js, ...) that we don't need/use
* Android Studio complains that the app uses an old, deprecated way of building => fix
* Consider upgrading the old Cordova 2.8 to the latest 3.0.x
* Add JavaDoc to classes
* Add documentation with links to good and brief intro into the key technologies used (GCM, ...)
* Consider switching to the more up-to-date and better licensed GCM plugin
